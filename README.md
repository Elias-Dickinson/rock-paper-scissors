Hello TOP!

This is my attempt at using functional programming to develop a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. I have what I think is a pretty good first attempt at funcitonal programming, albeit with two 'impure functions.'

What I think I have adequately demonstrated is competency in vanilla JS and functional programming fundamentals. Please feel free to let me know how I did!
